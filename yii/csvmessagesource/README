About:
------
For saving translation files as csv. Also it supports some additional options.
The files have following format:
    * they must end with .csv
    * they contain a csv list like "source message", "translated message"



Installation:
-------------
Copy CsvMessageSource.php file into your protected/extensions folder.
Inside your config.php add:
array(
    ...
    'components'=>array(
        ...
        'messages' => array(
            'class' => 'application.extensions.CsvMessageSource',
            //'defaultTranslation'=>'global',
            //'messageDir'=>'translation',
            //'languages'=>array('at'=>array('de', 'at')),
            //'delimiter'=>';',
        ),
        ...
    ),
    ...
)


Configurations:
---------------
I added some more configuration options:
defaultTranslation:
    Currently if you translate stuff like "yes" and "no" you have to do this once per category
    defaultTranslation is a category which will be additionally loaded to each category
    for example "global" will now look if there exists a global.csv and then load it
messageDir:
    If you dont want you translations stored insided the "messages" dir you can this option
languages:
    If you have a language which inherits from another one (at from de for example)
    you can specify it here and it will merge all translations together
delimiter:
    the csv delimiter
