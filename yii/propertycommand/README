About:
To improve Code Inspection for PHPStorm I needed to automatically add all database attributes as @property to my CActiveRecord classes. Additionally it adds all relations and some common used CActiveRecord methods too.





Installation:
Copy both .php files into your protected/commands folder.
Update db-configuration inside PropertyConfig.php

Run:
This command changes your code - so backup (or vcs) your code.
The database is accessed just readonly.

php yiic.php property commands/PropertyConfig.php

After it finished, all CActiveRecord classes should have updated @property thing at the beginning.

Similar to this:
/*
 * @property int id
 * @property string password
 * @property string name
 * @property bool active
 * @property Group group
 * @property array roles
 * @method User|CActiveRecord find()
 */
class User extends CActiveRecord




-----
How the code works:
    Walk through all files in a "/models/" directory
    Extract the tablename from the tableName() function
    Fetch the database information with yii - and map the database type into phpdoc types
    Extract the relations from the relations() function
    Find the class docstring and delete all @property and @method from there
    Add both above informations as @property
    Add some predefined functions as @method
